# ML-hands-on
I have explored a few datasets from kaggle and applies feature selection & engineering techniques and built a few machine learning models.

Purpose of Feature Selection
- Many learning algorithms perform poorly on high-dimensional data. This is known as 'the curse of dimensionality'
- There are other reasons we may wish to reduce the number of features including:
 1. Reducing computational cost
 2. Reducing the cost associated with data collection
 3. Improving Interpretability
